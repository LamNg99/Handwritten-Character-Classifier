    "# üìù Handwritten Character Regconition using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go through a machine learning project with the goal of classifying different handwritten characters including letters and digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will be using data downloaded from [EMNIST (Extended MNIST)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist). It consists of six different splits with details provided below: \n",
    "* EMNIST ByClass: 814,255 characters. 62 unbalanced classes.\n",
    "* EMNIST ByMerge: 814,255 characters. 47 unbalanced classes.\n",
    "* EMNIST Balanced:  131,600 characters. 47 balanced classes.\n",
    "* EMNIST Letters: 145,600 characters. 26 balanced classes.\n",
    "* EMNIST Digits: 280,000 characters. 10 balanced classes.\n",
    "* EMNIST MNIST: 70,000 characters. 10 balanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual breakdown of EMNIST datasets is specified as follow:\n",

    "Please refer to the [EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373v1) paper for more details of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the `EMNIST Balanced` dataset will be used to reduce mis-classification errors due to capital and lower case letters and also has an equal number of samples per class. The `EMNIST Balanced` includes two main datasets: \n",
    "* **emnist-balanced-train.csv** - 112,800 images \n",
    "* **emnist-balanced-test.csv** - 18,800 images\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image is stored in `CSV` files using a separated row and 785 columns (first column represents the class lable )\n"
